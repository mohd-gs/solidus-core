/**
 * ScreenHandler Mixin - Additional safety layer for virtual GUI protection.
 *
 * NOTE: We do NOT target the abstract quickMoveStack() method because
 * abstract methods have no body to inject into. Instead, this mixin
 * targets the clicked() method on AbstractContainerMenu as a safety net.
 *
 * The primary defense against unwanted item movement is already provided by:
 * 1. ShopScreenHandler.clicked() - Complete rewrite blocking all item movement
 * 2. ShopScreenHandler.quickMoveStack() - Returns ItemStack.EMPTY
 * 3. AuctionScreenHandler.clicked() - Same protection
 * 4. AuctionScreenHandler.quickMoveStack() - Returns ItemStack.EMPTY
 *
 * This mixin adds a final safety layer by ensuring that clicks on virtual
 * GUI containers are never processed by the default AbstractContainerMenu logic.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: SellScreenHandler is EXCLUDED from this safety net because it
 * implements its own cursor-based item movement in its clicked() override.
 * The sell GUI allows item placement, so its clicks must not be cancelled.
 * The SellScreenHandler.clicked() method does NOT call super.clicked(),
 * so this mixin's injection into AbstractContainerMenu.clicked() would not
 * fire for SellScreenHandler anyway. However, the check is explicit for clarity.
 *
 * Ghost Item Prevention:
 * If for any reason a click reaches this mixin and would result in item
 * movement in a Solidus virtual GUI, we cancel it AND force a container
 * resync via sendContentUpdates() to prevent ghost items from appearing
 * on the client due to the server-client state mismatch.
