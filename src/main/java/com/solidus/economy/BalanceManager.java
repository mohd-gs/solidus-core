/**
 * Balance Manager - High-level API for all economy balance operations.
 *
 * This is the primary interface through which commands, shop transactions,
 * and auction operations interact with the economy. It wraps the low-level
 * SQLiteStorage operations with business logic validation, anti-exploit
 * checks, and player notification.
 *
 * Thread Safety:
 * - All operations return CompletableFuture and execute asynchronously
 *   on the dedicated database worker thread.
 * - The caller (typically on the server tick thread) should use .thenAccept()
 *   or .thenApply() to process results and send player notifications.
 * - Operations that modify balances use SQLite IMMEDIATE transactions
 *   to prevent race conditions and duplication glitches.
